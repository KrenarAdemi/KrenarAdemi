## Hey, Krenar is here ðŸ‘‹

I design and build things that actually *look good* and *work fast.*  
Currently studying **Web Design & Development (DMIT)** at **NAIT**, where I mix clean UI with solid front-end code: HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and WordPress block themes.  

ðŸ’» **What Iâ€™m working on:**  
- Custom WordPress block theme (`krenars_theme`)  full-site editing, dynamic templates, and rem-based design system.   
- My own portfolio site [krenarademi.com](https://krenarademi.com) (live on Netlify).  

ðŸŒ± **Current focus:** mastering responsive layouts, accessibility, and front-end polish that passes real-world rubrics, not just class demos.  

âš¡ **Outside code:** Iâ€™m the kind of person whoâ€™ll tweak gradients at 2 AM and still have an eye on Kosovoâ€™s next football fixture.
