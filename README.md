## Hey, I’m Krenar Ademi 👋

I design and build things that actually *look good* and *work fast.*  
Currently studying **Web Design & Development (DMIT)** at **NAIT**, where I mix clean UI with solid front-end code — HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, and WordPress block themes.  

💻 **What I’m working on:**  
- Custom WordPress block theme (`krenars_theme`) — full-site editing, dynamic templates, and rem-based design system.   
- My own portfolio site [krenarademi.com](https://krenarademi.com) (live on Netlify).  

🌱 **Current focus:** mastering responsive layouts, accessibility, and front-end polish that passes real-world rubrics — not just class demos.  

⚡ **Outside code:** I’m the kind of person who’ll tweak gradients at 2 AM and still have an eye on Kosovo’s next football fixture.
