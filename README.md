ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Krenar

I design and build web experiences that actually look good, load fast, and make sense.
Currently studying Web Design & Development (DMIT) at NAIT, where I blend clean UI with efficient, standards-based front-end code.

ðŸ’» What Iâ€™m Working On

Custom WordPress Block Theme (krenars_theme): full-site editing, rem-based system, and dynamic templates.

My personal portfolio â€” krenarademi.com
 (live on Netlify).

Makerâ€™s Market Dashboard prototype built purely with Tailwind CLI â€” no JS, just smart utility logic.

ðŸ§  Current Focus

Building accessible, responsive layouts that pass real-world rubrics (not just class demos).

Polishing front-end workflows using Git, Netlify, and VS Code.

Leveling up in WordPress FSE, SEO, and E-E-A-T-driven content structure.

ðŸ§° Tech & Tools

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
Frameworks/Libraries: Tailwind CSS, WordPress (FSE & custom themes)
Tools: Git, GitHub, Netlify, VS Code, Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop
Database: MySQL (PDO-based queries, form validation, CRUD logic)
Other Skills: SEO optimization, content strategy, responsive UI, accessibility (WCAG), UX writing

âš¡ Beyond Code

Iâ€™m the type whoâ€™ll tweak a gradient at 2 AM just to make it feel right,
then switch tabs to check Kosovoâ€™s next football fixture âš½ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°.
